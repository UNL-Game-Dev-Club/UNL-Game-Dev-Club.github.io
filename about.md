We are UNL's only club focused on learning to develop video games. We meet weekly on Sundays at 7 pm in Avery Hall. All are welcome and there are no pre-requisites to join.

Our mission is to guide students in learning effective professional game design techniques. We accomplish this by working through game development projects in our meetings, such as demos or active projects. We also provide students the opportunity to showcase their skills at game development competitions ("game jams").

To get involved, please visit the Contact page and reach out to one of the club officers.
