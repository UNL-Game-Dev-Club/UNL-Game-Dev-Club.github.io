            <h1>Welcome to the UNL Game Development Club</h1>
            <p>We are UNL's only club focused on learning to develop video games. We meet weekly on Sundays at 7 pm in Avery Hall. All are welcome and there are no pre-requisites to join.</p>
            <p><b>Our mission: To teach students effective professional game design techniques.</b> We accomplish this by working through game development projects in our meetings, such as demos or active projects. We also provide students the opportunity to showcase their skills at game development competitions ("game jams").</p>
            <p>The group is still fairly new and growing, but we will update the website as new exciting projects and events arise.</p>

            <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
            <p>The GDC has some exciting events coming up, which we'd like to share with everyone!</p>

            <h3>Winter Break (Dec 17 - Jan 4)</h3>
            <p>There will not be any official meetings over winter break, but students are still encouraged to contribute to the ongoing game.<br>Safe travels to everyone who is traveling to see family over break!</p>
