				<h1>Welcome to the UNL Game Development Club!</h1>
				<p>
					We are UNL's only club focused on learning to develop video games.
					All are welcome and there are no prerequisites to join.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b
						>Our mission: To guide students in learning effective professional
						game development techniques.</b
					>
					We accomplish this by helping students organize into teams to get
					practical game development experience, as well as by discussing game
					design concepts and demonstrating technical processes. We also
					provide students the opportunity to showcase their skills at game
					jams, and help them find teammates to compete with.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get involved, you can join our
					<a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord">Discord</a>! If you have
					any other questions, feel free to visit the
					<a href="contact.html">contact page</a> and reach out to the club
					officers.
