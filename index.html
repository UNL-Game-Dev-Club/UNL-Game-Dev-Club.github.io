			<h1 class="header_padding">Welcome to the UNL Game Development Club!</h1>

			<p>We are UNL's only club focused on learning to develop video games. All are welcome and there are no prerequisites to join.</p>

			<p><b>Our mission: To guide students in learning effective professional game development techniques.</b> We accomplish this by helping students organize into teams to get practical game development experience, as well as by discussing game design concepts and demonstrating technical processes. We also provide students the opportunity to showcase their skills at game jams, and help them find teammates to compete with.</p>

			<p>To get involved, you can join our <a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a>! If you have any other questions, feel free to visit the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> and reach out to the club officers.</p>

			<h2 class="center_heading">Upcoming Events</h2>

			<p>The club generally meets on <strong>Sundays from 7 PM to 9 PM Central Time</strong>. Until further notice, we'll be meeting online over <a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>

			<h3>Free Assets Talk (February 27, 7 PM, ONLINE on Discord)</h3>

			<p>We'll be going over several places you can find free assets online, such as art, 3D models, music, and sound effects. Free assets can help you make prettier and more representative prototypes, and if their licenses permit it, you can even use them in your full game. We'll also cover a few free tools that you can use to randomly generate assets.</p>
