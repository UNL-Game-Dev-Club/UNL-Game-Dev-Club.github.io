			<h1 class="header_padding">Welcome to the UNL Game Development Club!</h1>

			<p>We are UNL's only club focused on learning to develop video games. All are welcome and there are no prerequisites to join.</p>

			<p><b>Our mission: To guide students in learning effective professional game development techniques.</b> We accomplish this by helping students organize into teams to get practical game development experience, as well as by discussing game design concepts and demonstrating technical processes. We also provide students the opportunity to showcase their skills at game jams, and help them find teammates to compete with.</p>

			<p>To get involved, you can join our <a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a>! If you have any other questions, feel free to visit the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> and reach out to the club officers.</p>

			<h2 class="center_heading">Upcoming Events</h2>

			<p>The club generally meets on <strong>Sundays from 7 PM to 9 PM Central Time</strong>. We are hoping to meet in person this semester, most likely in Avery Hall 19 or the Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts. For those who can't attend in-person, we'll be streaming each meeting on our <a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a>. However, we may have to meet entirely online depending on the university's latest COVID guidelines, so check back for updates.</p>

			<h3>Intro and Returning Team Meetings (February 6<sup>th</sup>, 7 PM, Location TBD)</h3>

			<p>This will be our first meeting of the Spring 2022 semester! This meeting is the perfect chance for new members to come learn more about the club. We will also have a chance for returning club members to discuss which teams want to continue working on their games into the spring semester. Individual team members will also be able to decide if they want to stay on their same team or consider other teams.</p>

			<h3>Pitch Meeting (February 13<sup>th</sup>, 7 PM, Location TBD)</h3>

			<p>This semester's pitch meeting will take place on Sunday, February 13<sup>th</sup>. As usual, any club member is free to pitch a game idea in a short presentation (usually 3-5 minutes long). Pitched games should have roughly the scope of a game jam game, and be possible for a team of part-time developers to complete over the course of the semester. Teams continuing from the Fall semester will also have an opportunity to do a brief pitch if they are interested in finding new team members. We'll release the game pitch form and role preferences form during the intro meeting the preceding week.</p>
