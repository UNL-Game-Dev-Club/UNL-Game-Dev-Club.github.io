            <h2>Our First Game</h2>
            <p>So far, we've only begun designing our first game. It will be a dungeon crawler built on the Unity 2018 game engine with several dungeons connected by an overarching story line. The player will have a time limit to complete each dungeon and a tech tree to help boost the player's abilities. More updates will follow.</p>
            
            <h2>Pong Demo (9/30/2018)</h2>
            <p>This pong project was created in the weekly meetings as a way to teach certain concepts, such as adding objects to a scene, attaching assets (scripts, materials, rigidbodies, etc) to game objects, introduction to collision detection, introduction to player input, and more.</p>
            <p>The project can be seen on the club's <a href="https://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Pong-Demo" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <h2>Transformation (Chillennium 2018)</h2>
            <p>This project was created for the Chillennium 2018 game jam competition at Texas A&M University by Casey Lafferty, Molly Lee, and Rongsong Yang. Casey Lafferty is a master's student in Computer Science, Molly Lee is a master's student in Computer Science, and Rongsong Yang is a sophomore in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>The project can be seen on the club's <a href="https://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Transformation" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
