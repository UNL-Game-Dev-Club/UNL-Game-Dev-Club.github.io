                <h2>Pizza Delivery</h2>
                <p>So far, we've worked on designing one game as a club. It is a dungeon crawler built on the Unity 2018 game engine with several dungeons connected by an overarching story line. The player will have a time limit to complete each dungeon and a tech tree to help boost the player's abilities. Current development has been put on hold.</p>
                <p>The code for this project can be found on the club's <a href="https://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Pizza-Delivery" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
