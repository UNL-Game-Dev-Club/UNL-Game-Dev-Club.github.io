                <h2>Pizza Delivery</h2>
                <p>So far, we've worked on designing one game as a club. It is a dungeon crawler built on the Unity 2018 game engine with several dungeons connected by an overarching story line. The player will have a time limit to complete each dungeon and a tech tree to help boost the player's abilities. Current development has been put on hold.</p>
                <p>The code for this project can be found on the club's <a href="https://github.com/UNL-Game-Dev-Club/Pizza-Delivery" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

                <h2>More projects to come!</h2>
                <p>The club is still relatively new and has been focused on getting students started in Unity. Once we have a system established to help students jumpstart their game development progress, more projects will be developed.</p>

                <p>Daniel Shchur, the club's primary programmer, and Nick Lehnert, the club's treasurer, led a demo on basic Git commands to help the group get familiar with GitHub as a collaboration platform. During this demo, the officers walked through basic ways to add files to a repository, modifying files, creating and merging branches, and cloning repositories.</p>
